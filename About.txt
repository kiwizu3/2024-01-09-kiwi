So, I am Kavinda and writing this to show you something I have worked on. This is the link to that https://github.com/kiwizu3/w3b-0001 

I am from Sri Lanka and I am a panda, as I am hiding it here but I am not a LLM so i guess I should not place that phrase here. I don't know. 

Anyways the above project was done as a hobby to polish up my skills in frontend development and I have used bootstrap 5 and React 18 in this specific project. 

I replicated a design I found on dribbble. Anyways here's few more things I have done for fun.

So I have been learning and trying out bootstrap with HTML5 and CSS and also a bit of React and NextJs. I have extensive experience on Adobe suite and Figma in wireframing and UI designing.
